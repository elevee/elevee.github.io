				<h4>SHE SAYS:</h4>
				<div class="body">
					<p>I really didn’t want to do the online dating thing. But why not? My BFF Cori said Tinder was fun! And Candice, heretoforewith known as my Fairy Godmother, offered [demanded] to approve anyone who wanted to chat with me online.</p>

					<p>Swipe, swipe, swipe...</p>

					<p><strong>Danielle:&nbsp</strong>“Candice! What do you think about this guy?”<br/>
						<strong>Candice:&nbsp</strong>“DANIELLE. He. Is. Perfect.”<br/>
						<strong>Danielle:&nbsp</strong>“He seems awesome right? Plays hockey, cooks, Jewish, CUTE...”<br/>
						<strong>Candice:&nbsp</strong>“You NEED to make this happen.”<br/>
						<strong>Danielle:&nbsp</strong>“He probably won’t even message me!”<br/>
					</p>

					<p>Except he did! And he was really funny and clever! There’s no way he’d be great in person.</p>

					<p>EXCEPT HE WAS. </p>

					<p>He even bought me Moscow mules and Brussels sprouts.</p>

					<p>We made plans immediately for the next night. But I was so tired from earlier birthday celebrations 
						that I took a nap. Eric hadn’t confirmed during the day so he wasn’t interested, right? When I got a 
						peace-out text from him I absolutely freaked out and asked Candice what to do. I followed her 
						instructions to the letter and we made up for my missteps over wine and a Japanese subtitled version 
						of Black Mass.</p>

					<p>Despite my best efforts to mess up everything that first week, Eric remained amazing and we even saw each other for a third time in four days.</p>

					<p>We went on our first trip to Denver in January of 2016 and I knew this was someone I wanted to keep traveling with. And laughing with. And pretty much everything else.</p>

				<h4>HE SAYS:</h4>
				<div class="body">
					<p>I'd love to say something uber-romantic about how I knew from the first time I saw Danielle's Tinder profile that this would be my future wife, but due to the limited information given, all I could deduce was that she was a cute girl in a cop Halloween costume and that she looked like a fun time (gotta keep those expectations low on dating apps).</p>
					<p>Once we met up at a bar on the Westside, it didn't take long to realize that I was on a date with a woman, and not another sketchy, immature girl. She was beautiful, whip smart, didn't take herself too seriously, conversation flowed, and I felt like I had known her for years.</p>
					<p>When it came time to leave, I walked her to the curb to wait for her approaching Uber. When it arrived, I gave her a kiss goodnight, to which she responded "Why didn't you do that earlier?"</p>
					<p>"Earlier? It's the first date."</p>
					<p>Since I was leaving soon for the holidays, we made immediate plans to meet up at a bar the following night. When she didn't show, I was confused and disappointed. I had never been stood up before, and things seemed to go so well during the previous night's date that I was excited to pick up where we left off.</p>
					<p>Thinking: "Another dating app sketchball for ya", I txted "It was nice meeting you." </p>
					<p>I'm glad we sorted that miscommunication out, because I would've missed out on a truly magnificent woman and partner.</p>
