				<h4>SHE SAYS:</h4>
				<p>I really didn’t want to do the online dating thing. But why not? My BFF Cori said Tinder was fun! And Candice, heretoforewith known as my Fairy Godmother, offered [demanded] to approve anyone who wanted to chat with me online.</p>

				<p>Swipe, swipe, swipe...</p>

				<p>
					“Candice! What do you think about this guy?”
					“DANIELLE. He. Is. Perfect.”
					“He seems awesome right? Plays hockey, cooks, Jewish, CUTE...”
					“You NEED to make this happen.”
					“He probably won’t even message me!”
				</p>

				<p>Except he did! And he was really funny and clever! There’s no way he’d be great in person.</p>

				<p>EXCEPT HE WAS. </p>

				<p>He even bought me Moscow mules and Brussels sprouts.</p>

				<p>And despite my best efforts to mess up everything that first week, Eric remained amazing. And Candice helped me realize this guy could ACTUALLY be this great, this fun, this handsome, this caring. I didn’t realize they had those on the internet!</p>

				<p>We went on our first trip to Denver in January of 2016 and I knew this was someone I wanted to keep traveling with. And laughing with. And pretty much everything else.</p>

				<p>We’ve been to games and wineries, pools and hot tubs, learned to scuba and cooked a ridiculous amount of food. Every day keeps getting better and I can’t wait for the next!</p>

				<h4>HE SAYS:</h4>
				<p>I had been on the apps for a while, and learned that you have to have low expectations.</p>
				<p>It didn't take long to realize that a Danielle date was not going to be like the other ones. She was beautiful, whip smart, conversation flowed, and I felt like I had known her for years.</p>
				<p>When it came time to leave, I walked her to the curb to wait for her approaching Uber. When it arrived, I gave her a kiss goodnight, to which I remember her responding "Why didn't you do that earlier?"</p>
				<p>"Earlier? It's the first date."</p>
				<p>Since I was leaving soon for Morocco, we made immediate plans to meet up at a bar the next night. When she didn't show, I was disappointed, as things really seemed to go very well during the previous night's date.</p>
				<p>Thinking: "Another Dating App Sketchball for ya", I txted "It was nice meeting you." It didn't make any sense, but </p>
