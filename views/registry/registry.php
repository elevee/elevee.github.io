		<p>We chose to go with more of a honeymoon registry than a material one. The link to it is below.</p>
			<!-- , since we wouldn't have a lot of space for it all! -->
		<p>The plan is to go to Fiji and check off a bunch of bucket list items, including (but in no way limited to) an over-water bungalow and a shark dive!</p>
		<p>Exclamation points!!!</p>
		<p>Registry can be found at HoneyFund below:</p>
