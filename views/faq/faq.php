		<h4>Where/when is [insert event here]?</h4>
		<p>Check out our <a href="/weekend">schedule</a> page!</p>

		<h4>How can I get around Paso if I don’t rent a car?</h4>
		<p>Uber and Lyft are always good bets. Especially if you’re going to enjoy all the wineries!</p>

		<h4>What about getting to the wedding?</h4>
		<p>Glad you asked! We will have a shuttle bus making two pickups before the wedding - 4:45pm and 5:15pm on Saturday. You can sign up for the shuttle when you RSVP (above!)</p>

		<h4>How about getting back to the hotel?</h4>
		<p>Obviously, you’ll want to come to the after party at the Courtyard. The shuttle will make return trips at 11pm, 11:30pm, and midnight. No sign ups required!</p>

		<h4>What should I wear?</h4>
		<p>The wedding is black tie optional. Long dresses and full suit & tie, please.</p>

		<h4>We completely understand it’s an adults-only event. Do you have contacts for a babysitter?</h4>
		<p>Check out <a href="http://www.savvysitters-slocounty.com" target="_blank">Savvy Sitters</a>. Their sitters are located in San Luis Obispo County, are background checked, and come highly recommended by our Paso friends.</p>
